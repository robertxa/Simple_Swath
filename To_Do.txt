TO DO
	- BUG?: Check frequency plot --> seems to be outside of min-max bounds...
	- simplify colorbar for frequency plot when more than one single swaths
	- Understand why scalebar is not coherent with map scale
	-

BUGS FOUNDS/TO BE CORRECTED
	- 2024/10/01: correction in shifting mode when plot in meters
	- 2024/10/04: ylim passed twice; solved.
	- 

DONE
	- 2024/02/01: save stats as a pickle binary file
	- 2024/02/01: Separate output graphs by default; option for subgraphs
	- 2024/09/13: Test if spl_inc and spl_wndw are larger than 3 * cell size
	- 2024/09/13: Add support for 3D Line String (wkbLineString25D)
	- 2024/09/17: Separate profiles when several features in the polylines shp, 1 profile for each polyline feature
	- 2024/09/17: Reorganization of the compuation and the graph drawing
	- 2024/09/17: Separate csv files when several features in the polylines shp, 1 file for each polyline feature
	- 2024/09/17: Improve input raster's nodata_value considerations
	- 2024/10/01: Give the possibility to the user to change the colormap of the raster
	- 2024/10/01: Give the possibility to the user to add the hillshade below the raster
	- 2024/10/01: Give the possibility to the user to Compute the hillshade through the module simple_swath
	- 2024/10/01: Give the possibility to the user when several features to plot, to choose the color of each swath, and each feature
	- 2024/10/01: Give the possibility to the user to choose title/axes/legends
	- 2024/10/02: remove DEM NaN values from the map plot
	- 2024/10/04: Add option for scalebar or no 
	- 2024/10/04: Add option for legend or not in the swath graph
